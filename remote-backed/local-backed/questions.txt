Q.

First, create a simple configuration to create a local_file resource within the directory called RemoteState. The resource block should be created inside the main.tf file. Follow the below specifications for provisioning this resource:

Resource Name: state

filename: /root/<variable  local-state>

content: "This configuration uses <variable  local-state> state"


Use the variable called local-state in the variables.tf file which is already created for you and make use of variable interpolation syntax ${..}.
