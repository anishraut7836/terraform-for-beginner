Suppose terraform script failed in middle in that case when terraform plan will show error so avoid this type of
issue terraform taint will help to solve the issue.

Example: Suppose through terraform file I am provisioning EC2 instance and running some remote exec command
ec2 has provisioned but remote exec failed in the middle in that case no need to destroy the ec2 and re-create
terraform taint will mark as completed for ec2 and when re-run the terraform apply then in that case
only terraform remote exec will execute.

#terraform taint aws_instance.webserver
#terraform plan
#terraform untaint aws_instance.webserver
