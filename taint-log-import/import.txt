Process to import existing resource in terraform

1. create the resource manually in main.tf file
2. run the terraform import command
3. manually update the main.tf file
4. run the terraform plan

Support I have to import the ec2 instance
#terraform import aws_instance.webserver-2 i-026e1be10d5326f7
but this will give the error so before running above command
I have to create the resource block in terraform file

resource "aws_instance" "webserver-2" {

}

keep the file empty and again run the terraform import command
#terraform import aws_instance.webserver-2 i-026e1be10d5326f7

Now update the manually resource block
resource "aws_instance" "webserver-2" {
    ami = "ami-dgd923610c"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    key_name = "ws"
    vpc-security_group_ids = ["sg-e83864662"]

}

take the details from AWS console or state file

#terraform plan



Ex-2
Using the AWS CLI inspect this EC2 instance and find the ID that is created by it.

Here are some of the specifications of this EC2 Instance:

AMI: ami-082b3eca746b12a89

Instance Type: t2.large

Key Name: jade

Solution

aws ec2 describe-instances --endpoint http://aws:4566  --filters "Name=image-id,Values=ami-082b3eca746b12a89" | jq -r '.Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId'
