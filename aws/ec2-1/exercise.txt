===============exercise -1 ===================
Using this configuration file write a resource block to provision a simple EC2 instance with the following specifications:


Resource Name: cerberus

AMI: ami-06178cf087598769c, use variable named ami

region: eu-west-2, use variable named region

Instance Type: m5.large, use variable named instance_type


===============exercise -2 ===================

A new SSH key pair has been created in the directory /root/terraform-projects/project-cerberus/.ssh.

The private key is called cerberus and the public key is called cerberus.pub


Using the public key, create a new key-pair in AWS with the following specifications:

Resource Name: cerberus-key

key_name: cerberus

Use the file functions to read the public key cerberus.pub


When ready, run a terrafom plan and apply to create this key pair.

===============exercise -3 ===================
Let us now configure the cerberus resource to make use of this key. Update the resource block to make use of the key called cerberus


===============exercise -4 ===================

Let us now install nginx with EC2 instance. To do this, let's make use of the user_data argument.

Using the file function again or by making use of the heredoc syntax, use the script called install-nginx.sh as the value for the user_data argument.



===============exercise -5 ===================
Create an Elastic IP resource with the following specifications:

Resource Name: eip
vpc: true
instance: id of the EC2 instance created for resource cerberus (use a reference expression)
create a local-exec provisioner for the eip resource and use it to print the attribute called public_dns to a file /root/cerberus_public_dns.txt on the iac-server.
