Q.
We have a file called woody.jpg stored at /root that has to be uploaded to a bucket called pixar-studios-2020.
This bucket already exists though and was created using the AWS CLI

Let's do that now and upload this image to the s3 bucket! Update the main.tf file with the following specifications:

Bucket: pixar-studios-2020
Key: woody.jpg
Source: /root/woody.jpg
Use object (resource) Name: upload
